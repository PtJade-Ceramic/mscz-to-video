## Requirements

**Only Windows 10 and macOS 10.15 or later are supported. Only 64-bit systems are supported.**

- MuseScore
- ffmpeg
- Python 3 (Python Libraries see below)
  - `numpy<2`
  - `Pillow`
  - `webcolors`
  - If you want faster rendering, you can install `torch` following the instructions at [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)

Extra requirements for the UI version:

- `PySide6`
- `psutil`
- `torch`

If you want to accelerate with Intel GPU, you can install [`intel_extension_for_pytorch`](https://github.com/intel/intel-extension-for-pytorch) with XPU support.

## UI Usage

**Latest version only. For older versions, please see release note of each version.**

1. Download the binaries from the [release page](https://github.com/CarlGao4/mscz-to-video/releases/latest) according to your platform.
   - Windows
      1. Download `mscz2video_[version].7z` and extract it first.
      2. As I've built for Nvidia GPU acceleration and Intel GPU acceleration, you need to choose your torch runtime version according to your hardware. The torch runtime should be downloaded from [release 0.2](https://github.com/CarlGao4/mscz-to-video/releases/0.2). Later versions uses the exact same runtimes. File names are like `torch-runtime-[arch].7z`.
         - If you have Nvidia graphics card whose compute capability is greater or equal to 3.5, you can choose the cuda version **`cu118`**.
         - For Intel graphic card, building a single binary is too large so I've splited it into 4 versions. If you have Core 11~14th generation CPU with integrated GPU or DG1 discrete GPU, you can choose **`mkl.gen12lp`**.
         - For Intel Arc Alchemist GPU (Arc Axxx) and Ponte Vecchio GPU (Datacenter GPU Max), you can choose **`mkl.xe-hpg.xe-hpc.xe-hpc-vg`**.
         - For Lunar Lake CPU (Intel Core Ultra 2xxV) and Battlemage GPU (Intel Arc Bxxx), you can choose **`mkl.xe2`**.
         - For Core Ultra series but using Raptor Lake Refresh Architectures (`100U` `120U` `150U` `220U` `250U` `210H` `220H` `240H` `250H` `270H`), they use old GPU architecture so you can choose **`mkl.gen12lp`**.
         - For other Intel Core Ultra Series 1 and 2 GPUs, please choose **`mkl.xe-lpg.xe-lpgplus`**.
         - If you do not have GPUs above or do not want to use GPU acceleration, you can choose the CPU version. **Both versions can use GPU accelerated encoding, but only the GPU version can accelerate rendering. If you've not installed the latest Intel graphics driver but installed the Intel GPU runtime, start up of the program will fail. Please install the latest Intel graphics driver first.**
      3. Extract the torch runtime into the application. `mscz2video.exe` should be in the same directory as `torch` folder.
   - macOS
      1. Download `mscz2video_xxx_macOS_[ARCH].dmg` and open it. Drag the app to the Applications folder. `[ARCH]` is the architecture of your Mac, which can be `arm64` or `x86_64`. Apple Developer is expensive so I can't sign the app, so if the app is blocked by macOS, you can refer to [Note for macOS users](#CannotOpen) below.
2. Create a MuseScore file and format it to fit your video, or use the provided example file `Flower Dance.mscz` (Requires MuseScore 4.4 or later). If you don't want your video to scroll, you need to set your page ratio same as your video resolution. You can do this by going to `Format` → `Page Settings` → `Page Size` → `Custom` → `Width` and `Height` to your desired ratio. Please do not change them too small as the default output size is 330 dpi (pixels per inch, wich means that 1 inch is 330 pixels). You can also change `Staff space` and add new systems to make each page shows better. Personally, I'd also recommend setting `Format` → `Style` → `Header & Footer` to make odd/even pages have the same header and footer.
3. Open the program (On Windows, you can just double-click `mscz2video.exe`).
4. Wait for the program to start up. Before the process is done, you can't load a mscz file. During start up, the program will search for MuseScore and FFmpeg. I've packed ffmpeg along with the program so you don't need to download it, but you need to download MuseScore yourself. The program will search for `C:\Program Files\MuseScore 4\bin\MuseScore4.exe` and `C:\Program Files\MuseScore 3\bin\MuseScore3.exe` on Windows, and `/Applications/MuseScore 4.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore` and `/Applications/MuseScore 3.app/Contents/MacOS/mscore` on macOS. If the program fails to find MuseScore, a dialog will pop up to ask you to set the path to MuseScore manually, just choose the correct path to MuseScore executable. On macOS, you need to enter the application package and find the executable in the `Contents/MacOS` folder. To open an application package, you need to press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>G</kbd> in Finder and enter the path.
5. Load the mscz file by clicking `Load MuseScore file` or dragging the file to the button. Before the file is loaded, you can't start rendering. During this time you can change other settings.
    1. **Video settings**: You can set the resolution and framerate of the video. The default resolution is 1920x1080 and the default framerate is 60fps. Other common resolutions are: `1280x720` (720p), `1920x1080` (1080p), `2560x1440` (1440p or 2K), `3840x2160` (4K), `7680x4320` (8K).
    2. **Bar and note highlight color**: the background color of the current bar and current note. You can set the color and transparency, and view the effects on the label.
    3. **Video range**: Start offset and end offset are the time before the first note and after the last note press (*NOT* after the last note release). You can also set the start time and duration of the video. Start time is calculated before the start offset, so if you set start time to 1 and start offset to 1, the video will start at 0 second. The video will end either when the duration is reached or when the last note is pressed, whichever comes first. The start time and duration are used by the program, but not arguments passed to ffmpeg.
    4. **parallel jobs**: The number of parallel jobs to render the video. The default is 1 on each device. Only cpu is available if you've downloaded the CPU version. On macOS, mps is always available if you have M-series SoC or AMD GPU. You can hover over the label to see the name of the device instead of the device ID.
    5. **Cache**: Cache limit will limit the number of frames stored in memory. Repeat frames may occur during rendering, when the program finds a frame that is already rendered, it will use the cached frame instead of rendering it again. However, if the cache limit is reached, the program will delete the oldest frame in the cache. Besides, since parallel rendering is supported, frames may not be rendered in order, so the program will also use the cache to store frames that are rendered but not yet used. The default cache limit is 60. Use device cache will store the original images in device memory, which will speed up the rendering process by avoiding transferring images from CPU to GPU memory. However, this will use more device memory. If your device memory is not sufficient, you can disable this option.
    6. **Smooth cursor**: Smooth cursor movement will make the cursor move smoothly between notes. Without smooth cursor, the note highlight area will jump to the next note when it is pressed. Just like the playback cursor inside MuseScore, MuseScore 3 does not have a smooth cursor, but MuseScore 4 does. Smooth cursor will make the render process much slower as almost no same frames can be cached.
    7. **Fixed note width**: If this option is enabled, the width of note highlight rectangle will be fixed to the value you set. If you set it to 0, the width of note highlight rectangle will be calculated automatically, which is the exact width of a quarter note read from the mscz file (Actually, it is calculated from the staff space. If it is not defined in the mscz file or input file is not a mscz file, the default value of MuseScore will be used). If you set it to a value greater than 0, the width of note highlight rectangle will be fixed to the value in pixels. Extra note width ratio will expand the note highlight area by the ratio you set. For example, if you set it to 0.4, the note highlight area will be expanded by 20% of the target note on each side. This can result better visual effects as paddings are added around the notes.
    8. **Resize function**: Resize function will resize each page to the target size. Crop will crop each page to the largest possible size with the same ratio while keeping the current note in the center. Rescale will resize each page to the target size, ignoring the ratio.
    9. **Encoder settings**: Please remember that this program WILL NOT verify whether your choices can produce valid video!
        - **Muxing audio into the video**: This program WILL NOT render audio automatically. You need to export the audio from MuseScore manually first and load it here (or drag it to the button). Please don't forget to set `Audio delay`. Usually, you need to set audio delay same as the `Start offset`, unless you are using other audio sources or start time is not 0. By enabling the link button (🔗, default enabled), this `Audio delay` value will be adjusted automatically to match your `Start offset` and `From` time settings (= `Start offset` - `From`).
        - **Video encoder settings**: You can choose the video codec and encoder. On Windows and Linux, all Intel, Nvidia, AMD graphic card acceleration are supported (even if you've downloaded the CPU version). Choose encoder ending with `_nvenc` for Nvidia, `_amf` for AMD, `_qsv` for Intel. Please note that the encoder may not be available on your system even if it is listed here. For codec, you can choose `h264` (`libx264`, `h264_*`), `hevc` (`libx265`, `hevc_*`), `vp9` (`libvpx-vp9`, `vp9_qsv`), `av1` (`libaom-av1`, `libsvtav1`, `av1_*`) and `prores`. GPU acceleration codecs on macOS ends with `_videotoolbox`.
        - **Video bitrate control**: You can set the video bitrate and quality. You can choose `VBR` (Variable Bitrate) and `CQP` (or `CRF` depending on the codec) for quality control.
        - **Audio codecs**: You can choose `aac` (the most common audio codec in videos), `libopus`, `flac` (lossless audio codec), `pcm` (lossless and uncompressed), `alac` (Apple Lossless Audio Codec), `mp3` (lossy audio codec) and `vorbis`. Bitrate control is not available for lossless audio codecs.
6. Now you can start rendering. The preview window will show the realtime rendering frame, refreshing twice a second for better rendering performance. Showing the log window will also slow down the render process, so you can hide it if you don't need it.

## Commandline usage

1. Clone this repo. There are two required files: `mscz2video.py` (Conversion commandline interface script) and `convert_core.py` (Conversion codes), so you can also just download these two files directly and put them in the same directory.
2. Create a MuseScore file. You can use the provided example file `Flower Dance.mscz` (Requires MuseScore 4.4 or later)
3. If you don't want your video to scroll, you need to set your page ratio same as your video resolution. You can do this by going to `Format` → `Page Settings` → `Page Size` → `Custom` → `Width` and `Height` to your desired ratio. Please do not change them too small as the default output size is 360 dpi. You can also change `Staff space` and add new systems to make each page shows better. Personally, I'd also recommend setting `Format` → `Style` → `Header & Footer` to make odd/even pages have the same header and footer.
4. Prepare FFmpeg and MuseScore. You can install them using your package manager, or download [MuseScore](https://musescore.org) and [FFmpeg Windows Build By Gyan.dev](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/ffmpeg-release-essentials.zip). Find the path to `ffmpeg` and `MuseScore` executable. You need to set the path to `ffmpeg` and `MuseScore` with `--ffmpeg-path` and `--musescore-path` respectively later.
5. Before converting the file, you may need to learn some basic usage of FFMpeg as this script only passes frames and output file name to FFMpeg and the frames are in `RGB24` format but usually videos are encoded in `YUV420p` format. You may also read help of this script by running `python3 mscz2video.py --help` as it has a lot of options to customize the output video. Refer to [Command Line Arguments](#command-line-arguments) for more information.
6. Now you can convert the file by running `python3 mscz2video.py "Flower Dance.mscz" "Flower Dance.mp4" --ffmpeg-path "path/to/ffmpeg" --musescore-path "path/to/MuseScore" --start-offset 1 --end-offset 5 -r 30 -s 1920x1080 -j 4 --smooth-cursor "--" -i "Flower Dance.flac" -c:v libx265 -b:v 768k -c:a aac -b:a 128k -pix_fmt yuv420p -tag:v hvc1` to create a video with 30 fps, 1920x1080 resolution, 1 second wait time before the first note, 5 seconds wait time after the last note, 4 parallel jobs, smooth cursor movement, and encoded with libx265 and aac codec, just like the video above. This script does not automatically add audio to the video, so I added the audio file by passing additional arguments to ffmpeg (all arguments after `"--"` will not be parsed and are passed to ffmpeg directly). Remember to export the audio file from MuseScore first manually.
7. You can also use PyTorch (which supports GPU) for faster rendering. For usage, you can read the script help.
